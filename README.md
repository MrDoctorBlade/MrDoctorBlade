- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrDoctorBlade
- 👀 I have a keen interest and fascination with web development, networking, and software development.
- 🌱 I'm in the initial stages of learning both front-end and back-end development as a starting point on this journey. I'm just getting started, and I'm committed to learning as quickly as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (TBD). Not now, I am still learning. LOL.
- 📫 How to reach me? Maybe here if, you want to teach me something good. Thank you.
- 😄 Pronouns: Blade, Doctor Blade! LOL.
- ⚡ Fun fact: With a lengthy career in engineering, albeit not in software development or networking, I believe delving into these areas will offer me insight into the "inner workings" behind the screen.
